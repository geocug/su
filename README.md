This directory contains seismic-unix teaching material since Spring 2012, especially for seismic data processing lab course in China University of Geosciences(CUG).

The orginal seismic-unix source on cwp site is not aviable to  CUG students during spring 2018. The file cwp_su_all_43R3.tgz is a simple fix for this problem. 

These materials are free for teaching/academic purpose. The copyrights are left to the original authors/organizations.
